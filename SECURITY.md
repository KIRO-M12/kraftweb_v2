Framework Compatibility & Security Policy

This project is built with an adaptive approach to multiple frameworks, leveraging best practices from various resources such as [website name or URL]. Each framework is carefully tailored to optimize style handling, inline transformations, and compatibility, ensuring a robust, consistent experience across multiple tech stacks.
Framework Compatibility & Optimizations

    Laravel/Vue.js: Styling is customized for Vue components, with SCSS integration and JavaScript compatibility to ensure smooth performance.
    React/Next.js (with TypeScript): JSX style attributes are automatically converted (e.g., camelCase to kebab-case) to align with CSS standards, maintaining full TypeScript compatibility.
    jQuery: Inline style adjustments provide backward compatibility with legacy JavaScript, ensuring a unified handling across frameworks.

    Note: Styling and functional elements are optimized for each framework to maintain consistency and functionality inspired by best practices on [website name].
